## 10/22/2025 - Design Phone stand

It was a good exercise in creating a functional, practical object while practicing design skills.![Screenshot 2025-10-22 143501.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUxOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4815319172da74397adf5541e7ea3961cee495f5/Screenshot%202025-10-22%20143501.png)
